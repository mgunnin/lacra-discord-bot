# Recent Notable Updates  

- **Code-Interpreter / Advanced Data Analysis** - Just like ChatGPT GPTDiscord now has a fully fledged code execution environment. You can work with GPT to execute your code in an isolated environment, with the ability to even install python and system packages, and access the internet from the execution environment.


- **Multi-modality** - GPTDiscord now supports images sent to the bot during a conversation made with `/gpt converse`!


- **Internet-connected Chat!** - Chat with an instance of GPT3.5 or GPT-4 that's connected to google and wolfram alpha and can browse and access links that you send it!

# Commands  
  
These commands are grouped, so each group has a prefix but you can easily tab complete the command without the prefix. For example, for `/gpt ask`, if you type `/ask` and press tab, it'll show up too.  
  
`/help` - Display help text for the bot  
  
### (Chat)GPT Commands  
  
`/gpt ask <prompt> <temp> <top_p> <frequency penalty> <presence penalty>` Ask the GPT Davinci 003 model a question. Optional overrides available  
  
`/gpt edit <instruction> <input> <temp> <top_p>` Use the bot to edit text using the given instructions for how to do it, currently an alpha openai feature so results might vary. Editing is currently free  
  
`/gpt converse <opener> <opener_file> <private> <minimal>` - Start a conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT. Also use the option `use_threads:False` to start a conversation in a full discord channel!
  
- `opener:<opener text>` - Start a conversation with the bot, with a custom opener text (this is useful if you want it to take on a custom personality from the start).  
  
- `opener_file:<opener file name>.txt|.json` - Starts a conversation with the bot, using a custom file.   
  
  - Loads files from the `/openers` folder, has autocomplete support so files in the folder will show up. Added before the `opener` as both can be used at the same time  
  
  - Custom openers need to be placed as a .txt file in the `openers` directory, in the same directory as `gpt3discord.py`  
  
 - Enables minimal  
  
  - Can use .json files in the `{"text": "your prompt", "temp":0, "top_p":0,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0}` format to include permanent overrides  
  
- `private` - Start a private conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT  
  
- `minimal` - Start a conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT, with minimal context (saves tokens)  
  
`/gpt end` - End a conversation with the bot.  

`/gpt instruction mode:<set/get/clear> type:<user/channel> <instruction> <instruction_file>` - The commands let you set a system instruction for 3.5-turbo and gpt4, or just prepending text for davinci and older models. Instruction will be added to prompts but not shown. The command has 3 options, `set` and `clear` can only be used with the `channel` type if the user has the `CHANNEL_INSTRUCTION_ROLES` role. User set instructions take priority, then channel instructions. This effect applies to `/gpt ask`, @ing the bot and the right click context menu options.

* set
  * Lets you set an instruction for yourself with `user` or the channel you run the command in with `channel`
  * `instruction` allows setting the text normally
  * `instruction_file` allows upload of a file, similar to the openers
  * When using both `instruction` and `instruction_file`, they will be combined with `instruction` appended after the `instruction_file`
* get
  * Prints the currently set instruction for either the `user` or `channel` it is ran in.
* clear
  * Removes the currently set instruction for either the `user` or `channel` it is ran in.

### Code Interpreter // Advanced Data Analysis Commands
`/code chat` - Start a code interpreter chat with GPT. You can type `end` to end the conversation

### Search & Internet Commands

`/internet search:<prompt> scope:<number of sites to visit> nodes:<how deep gpt should think>` - Search the internet with GPT assistance!

- The `scope` defines how many top level websites to visit during the search, capped at 6
- `nodes` defines how many nodes inside the built index after webpage retrieval to use. 
- Increasing the scope or the nodes will make the requests take longer and will be more expensive, but will usually be more accurate.
  
`/internet chat search_scope:<number> model:<turbo or gpt4>` - Start an internet-connected chat with GPT, connected to Google and Wolfram.

### Custom Indexes Commands  
  
This bot supports per-user custom indexes. This means that users can upload files of their choosing, such as PDFs and ask GPT to answer questions based on those files.  
  
`/index add file:<file> or link:<link>` - Use a document or use a link to create/add to your indexes. If you provide a youtube link, the transcript of the video will be used. If you provide a web url, the contents of the webpage will be used, if you provide an image, the image text will be extracted and used!  
  
`/index query query:<prompt> nodes:<number> response_mode:<mode>` - Query your current index for a given prompt. GPT will answer based on your current document/index. You can also set it to query over more nodes, further refining the output over each one. A description of the modes can be found <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/usage_pattern.html#setting-response-mode">here</a>. They do not work for deep composed indexes  
  
`/index load user_index:<index> or server_index:<index>` - Load a previously created index you own yourself, or an index for the whole server.  
  
`/index compose` - Combine multiple saved indexes into one, or upgrade existing indexes into Deep Compositions.  
  
`/index reset` - Reset and delete all of your saved indexes  
  
`/index add_discord channel:<discord channel>` - Create an add an index based on a discord channel  
  
`/index discord_backup` - Use the last 3000 messages of every channel on your discord server as an index. Needs both an admin and a index role  

`/index chat user_index:<user_index> search_index:<search_index>` - Chat with your documents that you've indexed previously!

### DALL-E2 Commands  
  
`/dalle draw <prompt>` - Have DALL-E generate images based on a prompt  
  
`/dalle optimize <image prompt text>` Optimize a given prompt text for DALL-E image generation.  

### System and Settings  
  
`/system settings` - Display settings for the model (temperature, top_p, etc)  
  
`/system settings <setting> <value>` - Change a model setting to a new value. Has autocomplete support, certain settings will have autocompleted values too.  

- For example, if I wanted to change the number of images generated by DALL-E by default to 4, I can type the following command in discord: `/system settings num_images 4`  
  
`/system usage` Estimate current usage details (based on davinci)  
  
`/system settings low_usage_mode True/False` Turn low usage mode on and off. If on, it will use the curie-001 model, and if off, it will use the davinci-003 model.  
  
`/system delete-conversation-threads` - Delete all threads related to this bot across all servers.  
  
`/system local-size` - Get the size of the local dalleimages folder  
  
`/system clear-local` - Clear all the local dalleimages.
